# Django Web Framework R&D Lab 🧪

A centralized Research & Development repository for prototyping advanced Django design patterns, architectural benchmarks, and reference implementations.

This lab serves as a testing ground for exploring the limits of the Django ecosystem, focusing on performance, scalability, and enterprise-grade best practices before they are applied in production environments.

## 🚀 Research Focus Areas
This repository aggregates 30+ distinct prototyping modules covering:

* **Advanced Middleware:** Custom request processing for security, logging, and tenant context.
* **ORM Performance:** Benchmarking `Raw SQL` vs `Django ORM` query plans for complex aggregations.
* **Security Implementation:** Reference patterns for RBAC, JWT, and OAuth2 integration.
* **Design Patterns:** Practical implementations of Service Layers, Selectors, and Factory patterns in Django.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.10+, Django 4.x
* **Database:** sqlite and mysql workbench (with complex indexing prototypes)
