# Django Web Framework R&D Lab 🧪

A centralized **Research & Development repository** for prototyping advanced Django design patterns, architectural benchmarks, and reference implementations.

This lab acts as a **controlled experimentation environment** to explore the limits of the Django ecosystem, with a focus on **performance, scalability, and enterprise-grade backend practices** before adoption in production systems.

---

## 🚀 Research Focus Areas

This repository aggregates **30+ independent prototyping modules**, each targeting a specific architectural or performance concern:

### 🔹 Advanced Middleware
- Custom request/response processing
- Security interception and audit logging
- Tenant and request context propagation

### 🔹 ORM Performance & Query Optimization
- Benchmarking Django ORM vs Raw SQL
- Query plan analysis for complex joins and aggregations
- Indexing strategies and performance trade-offs

### 🔹 Security Implementations
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- JWT-based authentication flows
- OAuth2 integration patterns

### 🔹 Backend Design Patterns
- Service Layer pattern for business logic isolation
- Selector pattern for query encapsulation
- Factory and abstraction patterns for extensibility

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Core**
- Python 3.10+
- Django 4.x

**Database**
- SQLite (rapid prototyping)
- MySQL (schema design & indexing experiments)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Lab

- Validate architectural decisions before production rollout
- Serve as a reference for scalable Django backend design
- Benchmark performance trade-offs across multiple approaches
- Support mentoring, knowledge sharing, and team enablement

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is **not production code**.  
Modules are intentionally isolated and experimental, optimized for **learning, benchmarking, and architectural evaluation** rather than deployment.
